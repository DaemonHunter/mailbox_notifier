# Mailbox Buddy

This device is the creation of my Student Innovation Project required for graduation from UAT. Here is a little information about the project:


My Student Innovation Project will consist of a mailbox light/notifier. When I use my mailbox late at night it is sometimes difficult to see inside so my device would mount in the back of the mailbox and turn on an led to illuminate the interior of the mailbox. Additionally the mailbox will notify the user via email of the access to the mailbox. This will help notify when the mail gets dropped off while waiting for something important or to inform you that someone else is accessing your mailbox. This can be especially helpful in areas prone to mail theft to work proactively and remove your mail quickly, or to log when you are being hit to notify the authorities.
