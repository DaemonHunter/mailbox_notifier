# Mailbox Buddy

This device is the creation of my Student Innovation Project required for graduation from UAT. Here is a little information about the project:


My Student Innovation Project will consist of a mailbox light/notifier. When I use my mailbox late at night it is sometimes difficult to see inside so my device would mount in the back of the mailbox and turn on an led or led strip to illuminate the interior of the mailbox. Additionally I would like the mailbox to notify the user via SMS or email, that their mailbox has been opened. This will help notify of when the mail gets dropped off when waiting for something important or to inform you that someone else is accessing your mailbox. This can be especially helpful in areas prone to mail theft.
