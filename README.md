# Mailbox Buddy

This device is the creation of my Student Innovation Project required for graduation from UAT. 
Here is a little information about the project:


My Student Innovation Project consists of a mailbox light with an E-Mail notifier. When using the mailbox late at night, it is sometimes difficult to see inside. This device mounts to the side of the mailbox and turns on an led to illuminate the interior of the mailbox. Additionally the user is notified via email that their mailbox has been opened. This will helps to notify when the mail gets dropped off if waiting for something important or to inform you that someone else is accessing your mailbox. This can be especially helpful in areas prone to mail theft to work proactively and remove your mail quickly, or to log when you are being hit to notify the authorities.
